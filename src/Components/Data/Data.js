        more:'To become muscular, you also have to lift more and more weight; they are similar to each other. What sets them apart is that muscle growth is at best between 6-12 reps per set, on some exercises even higher. To build strength and get your body used to extreme loads, you have to lift very near your max, and the number of reps then ends up between 1-6, which is not optimal for muscle growth. So you should be strong in both cases, but it is about which reps interval you focus on. 1-6 for strength and 6 to at least 12 for muscle growth. So you can become strong as an ox without being incredibly muscular, while you can become muscular without lifting extreme weights. The two often go hand in hand, but they can also differ.',
